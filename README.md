# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-

The purpose of this project is to take handwritten characters as input. Train the Convolutional neural
network algorithm to recognize the pattern and modify the character to a beautified version of the input.


The objectives are:
To provide an easy user interface to input the object image.
System should be able to pre-process the given input to suppress the background.
System should detect text regions present in the image.
System should retrieve text present in the image and display them to the user.
